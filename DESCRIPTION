Description: Provides a minimal interface to define codebooks as data frames or CSV
    files and publish them as human-readable HTML and machine-readable SKOS/Turtle
    with stable hash URIs. Codebooks can be linked to datasets created with the
    'dataset' package and harmonized with 'retroharmonize'. This is the reference
    implementation of the 'Open Codebooks' approach, designed to be easily
    replicated in other languages.
