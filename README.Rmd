The goal of `rOpenCodebooks` is to a minimal interface to define codebooks as data frames or CSV files and publish them as human-readable HTML and machine-readable SKOS/Turtle with stable hash URIs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rOpenCodebooks from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("dataobservatory-eu/opencodebooks")
```

## OpenCodebooks

`OpenCodebooks` is not just a package — it’s a pattern.  
The idea is that **codebooks should be as open and portable as the data they describe**.

- **Hash URIs**: Every category gets a stable, citable identifier.  
- **Minimal**: Define codebooks in a plain CSV or data frame.  
- **Templated**: Render them into human-readable HTML and machine-readable Turtle (SKOS).  
- **Static**: Publish on GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, or any static host. No server config.  


```{r example}
library(opencodebooks)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so.
